Here is the documentation:

**Summary of Libraries Used:**

* `selenium`: This library is used to automate web browsers. It is used to start a chrome browser instance, navigate to Google Drive, log in to the account, and upload a video file.
* `random`: This library is used to choose a random video file to upload.
* `os`: This library is used to get the full path of the video file.
* `time`: This library is used to wait for pages to load and for the upload to complete.

**Modifications Necessary to Run the Code on Your Device:**

* You need to have the chromedriver executable installed on your device. You can download it from the official chromedriver website.
* You need to replace the `driver_path` variable with the path to the chromedriver executable on your device.
* You need to replace the `video_path` variable with the path to the video files on your device.
* You need to replace the email and password in the script with your own Google account credentials.

**Data Used for Testing:**

* The script uses a list of video files to choose from. You can replace this list with your own video files.
* The script uses a Google account to log in to Google Drive. You can replace the email and password with your own Google account credentials.

**Summary of the Code's Functionality:**

* The script starts a chrome browser instance and navigates to Google Drive.
* It logs in to the account using the provided email and password.
* It uploads a random video file from the list of video files.
* If the file is already uploaded, it replaces the old file with the new one.
* Finally, it quits the browser instance.
